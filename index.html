     <h2>Hello</h2>
     <p class="intro">I am a student of Ningbo City College of Vocational Technology</p>
       <h2>Self-introduction</h2><br>
       <p>First, let me make a brief introduction of myself. My name is Abbott. I come from Ningbo, a beautiful city in Zhejiang Province. I am a student of Ningbo City Polytechnic. My major is computer application technology.
          My greatest strength is my ability to study independently and solve problems independently. I'm a hard worker and responsible.
          As we all know, in this field, technology changes very quickly. It is difficult and unnecessary for us to master all this. Therefore, the ability to learn quickly is very important. Speaking of independence, it's not that I don't want to communicate with others, but I'm good at solving problems independently. For example, when I encounter a difficult technical problem, the first thing I do is use all the relevant tools at hand, such as Google or library books to solve it. I don't ask for help in the first place unless I try to solve it myself.
          In terms of responsibility, I try to develop the habit of considering all aspects of the job, analyzing the pros and cons, making sure there are no problems, and being responsible for the work I need to complete. My goal is to keep everything on schedule. I will never give up. </p>>
